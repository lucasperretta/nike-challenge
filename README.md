# Nike Urban Dictionary App Challenge

Hi! Thank you for this opportunity. This app was made in pure Kotlin, using the MVVM Software Architecture and a custom HTTPRequest Async class. The design was copied and adapted to mobile from the Urban Dictionary website and build in XML files. I made some Kotlin extensions for ease of use and used the Kotlin Extensions Gradle Plugin.

Hope you like it! Lucas Perretta
